Experiments
===========

Some experimental stuff.

Bad Links Report
----------------

The bad_links_report directory contains a few ruby and shell scripts that process
a log file produced by SiteSucker on the Macintosh.  The resulte is a text file
that lists the bad hyper-links found.


Accessing The MarkLogiv Database
--------------------------------

The marklogic_db directory contains a demonstration of the use of the active_document
gem used to interact with the MarkLogic database.  One of the gem dependencies is
"tuple" which has problems compiling its C extension under MacOS X Mountain Lion.

Demo works find on a linux/fedora platform.

The active_directory gem may no be actively maintained.
