Ruby Access to MarkLogic DB
===========================

The gem "active_document" is supposed to provided access to the
MarkLogic database.  However, its old and does not look like it
is being maintained.  Regardless, it depends on the gem "tuple" which
is having compile problems under MacOS X (10.8.3 Mountain Lion.)  Under
MacOS X 10.6.3 there were no problems and the demo program worked
as expected.

The "tuple" compile seems to be one of 32-bit verse 64-bit architecture
in some of its variables.
