Racquetball is a racquet sport played with a hollow rubber ball
in an indoor or outdoor court. Joseph Sobek[1] is credited with
inventing the modern sport of racquetball in 1950 (the outdoor,
  one-wall game goes back to at least 1910 in N.Y.C.),[2] adding a
stringed racquet to paddleball in order to increase velocity and
control. Unlike most racquet sports, such as tennis and badminton,
there is no net to hit the ball over, and unlike squash no tin (out of
  bounds area at the bottom of front wall) to hit the ball above. Also,
the court's walls, floor, and ceiling are legal playing surfaces, with the
exception of court-specific designated hinders being out-of-bounds.[3] It is
very similar to 40x20 handball, which is played in many countries.
