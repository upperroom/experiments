Title               Change

LongReading         Read Psalm 98:1-6

QuotedScripture     Shout for joy to the Lord.

Citation            — Psalm 98:4 (NIV)

BodyText            Early in May, I was talking with a neighbor who was disappointed that the
                    leaves of his maple tree hadn’t yet changed color. Within a few days of
                    our conversation we experienced three successive frosts, our first for
                    the year. Suddenly, the neighbor’s tree, along with thousands of others
                    around town, changed dramatically. They took on the oranges, reds, and
                    deep gold colors that had been missing throughout our mild autumn. Driving
                    around our streets became such a delight as the trees suddenly blazed with
                    color and seemed to shimmer as gentle breezes stirred within the leaves.

BodyText            Normally I dislike the start of the frosty winter season, but
                    this year it brought such a complete change in the foliage that
                    I was able to rejoice in the amazing beauty of God’s creation.

BodyText            So often I’m ready to see the downside of changes occurring around me but fail
                    to remember to thank God as I also begin to see the benefits of the changes.
                    This autumn I felt nurtured, as God gently showed me how all of creation
                    works together to create beauty and wonder. It deepened my trust in God and
                    helped me to learn to look for reasons to rejoice in everything I experience.

Prayer              Prayer: Wonderful, creative God, thank you for all the
                    blessings you shower upon us. Help us to rejoice with
                    you in the beauty and the good in all you give us. Amen.

Title               Faith of a Child

LongReading         Read Mark 10:13-16

QuotedScripture     Whoever does not receive the kingdom of
                    God as a little child will never enter it.

Citation            — Mark 10:15 (NRSV)

BodyText            When my daughter was four she came to me with a broken toy and asked
                    me to fix it. Often when her toys would break I would be able to snap
                    or glue a piece back on. However, this time she had snapped a piece in
                    half. “I’m sorry honey; I can’t fix this,” I told her. She responded,
                    “Mom, let’s pray to Jesus to fix it.” How do you explain to a child who
                    believes that Jesus can do anything that the toy will still be broken?
                    Yet, when I told her that we could pray but that Jesus probably was
                    not going to fix her toy, she simply responded, “Let’s pray anyway.”

BodyText            At that moment I understood why Jesus told his disciples that to enter the
                    kingdom of heaven you must become like a little child. (See Matt. 18:3; Mark
                    10:15.) At the age of four, my daughter understood that God loves us and wants
                    us to pray even if we do not think we are going to get the answer we want.

BodyText            I often think I need to handle my problems on my own, that they are too small
                    for God. However, my daughter reminded me that nothing is too small for God.
                    God wants us to lay all our burdens down and trust in God’s love for us.

Prayer              Prayer: Dear loving God, help us remember that nothing is
                    too small to bring to you in prayer. Help us bring all
                    of our burdens to you with the faith of a child. Amen.

ThoughtForTheDay    Thought for the DayToday I will pray with the faith of a child.

Title               Unsung Heroes

LongReading         Read John 1:35-42

QuotedScripture     One of the two who heard John speak and
                    followed him was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.

Citation            — John 1:40 (NRSV)

BodyText            I recently read a book that outlined the lives of Jesus’ twelve disciples.
                    I was especially interested to learn about Andrew. As today’s scripture
                    points out, he introduced his brother Peter to Christ, and Peter turned
                    out to be the leader of the disciples. But all of that happened because
                    of what Andrew did. To me, Andrew was an unsung hero among the disciples.

BodyText            The Bible certainly has its “star players,” the ones we hear
                    about often in the Old and New Testaments. But our heritage of
                    faith also includes the less well-known players, like Andrew,
                    who play an important role without receiving as much attention.

BodyText            Our role in serving God may receive lots of attention, and there’s
                    nothing wrong with that. But when it comes to serving the Lord, all
                    roles are important — even those that seem to be minor. The apostle
                    Paul summed it up well in his letter to the Colossians: “Whatever you
                    do, work at it with all your heart . . . It is the Lord Christ you
                    are serving” (3:23, 24, NIV). That’s a great reminder for us all.

Prayer              Prayer: Dear God, thank you for those who do your work
                    without expecting recognition from others. Help us
                    to remember that the work we do is your work. Amen.

ThoughtForTheDay    Thought for the DayGod calls us to serve even when we don’t receive recognition.

Title               Be Still

LongReading         Read Psalm 46:1-11

QuotedScripture     Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most
                    High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.

Citation            — Psalm 91:1 (NIV)

BodyText            Working in a small cottage hospital I see and hear many things. Most of those
                    who come in for care are elderly. Some of our patients are with us because of
                    a fall. Some come to us for help with chronic diseases such as Parkinson’s.
                    During visiting hours one afternoon I observed a patient’s daughter sitting
                    with her mother face-to-face next to her bed. No word was spoken throughout
                    their time together, yet it did not seem at all awkward. I assumed that they
                    had shared so much of each other’s lives over so many years that they could
                    sit there in silence, comfortably safe and content in each other’s company.

BodyText            This scene made me think of how I fill my life and prayers with
                    unnecessary words and often miss the opportunity simply to be in
                    God’s presence. As I watched that mother and daughter sit together,
                    Psalm 46:10 spoke to me clearly: “Be still, and know that I am God; I
                    will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.”

Prayer              Prayer: We praise you, dear Lord, for your constant
                    presence. Help us to quiet our lives and understand the
                    awesome beauty of spending time in your presence. Amen.

Title               Gardening with God

LongReading         Read John 15:1-8

QuotedScripture     Grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior
                    Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and forever!

Citation            — 2 Peter 3:18 (NIV)

BodyText            A beginning gardener, I admired my lush tomato plants. Their green
                    foliage and bright yellow blossoms promised delicious tomatoes.
                    One evening, a local vegetable grower stopped by my garden.

BodyText            “These are suckers,” he said, pointing to stray stems. “Cut them off.
                    They’re a haven for diseases and pests, and they take energy away from
                    producing tomatoes.” I got out my clippers and pruned. Then I groaned in
                    disgust as my efforts revealed hornworms! These plump caterpillars had
                    been hiding in the dense leaves, munching away and destroying my plants.

BodyText            Jesus warned his disciples about the need for pruning to help a plant bear
                    more fruit: “I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener. He cuts
                    off every branch in me that bears no fruit, while every branch that does
                    bear fruit he prunes so that it will be even more fruitful” (John 15:1-2).

BodyText            The Master Gardener wants me to prune what is unproductive in my life so I
                    can pour my energy into bearing fruit. If I trim away bad habits and cut out
                    activities that diminish my service, I can reduce opportunities for sin to creep
                    into my life unnoticed. That way I can be a fruitful servant in God’s kingdom.

Prayer              Prayer: Dear Lord, thank you for planting your word in our hearts.
                    Help us to grow in Christ and to bear fruit in your kingdom. Amen.

Title               Giving and Receiving

LongReading         Read 2 Corinthians 9:6-15

QuotedScripture     God loves a cheerful giver.

Citation            — 2 Corinthians 9:7 (NRSV)

BodyText            Several years ago, just before Easter, my brother and I took a youth group to
                    visit young children at a group home. After playing with the children, we moved
                    into a large living room for refreshments. I could hardly wait for the finale my
                    brother and I had planned. For each child we had brought a giant Easter basket
                    full of eggs and candy. In the center of each basket was a large chocolate egg
                    decorated with pink and green flowers and “Happy Easter” written in icing.

BodyText            We passed out the baskets and watched the children’s faces. My smile grew
                    bigger by the second. Then the four-year-old girl who had become my friend
                    during the day came to me and offered me her chocolate egg. As I started
                    to say, “You keep it, Sweetheart,” her housemother, who was behind her,
                    motioned for me to take it. I gratefully accepted the little girl’s offering.

BodyText            Later, the housemother explained, “The kids receive gifts
                    all the time, but they seldom have the joy of giving.”

BodyText            Like that little girl, we can all find great joy in giving to
                    others the gifts, both large and small, that God has given to us.

Prayer              Prayer: Dear God, thank you for giving to us so that we can
                    give to others. Help us to be gracious recipients. Amen.

Title               Praying Like Paul and Harold

LongReading         Read Colossians 1:9-14

QuotedScripture     Devote yourselves to prayer, being watchful and thankful.

Citation            — Colossians 4:2 (NIV)

BodyText            Harold was a member of our small group who loved God and was
                    passionate about serving. He was an older man with godly
                    wisdom and was much respected and appreciated by our group.

BodyText            When we prayed together and for each other I noticed a difference
                    between Harold’s prayers and my own. My prayers often sounded like a
                    shopping list of requests. Harold’s prayers were more like the prayers
                    of Paul and others that are found in the Bible. Paul and Harold
                    prayed for spiritual blessings for others. They prayed for things
                    that really got to the core of people’s needs, so that those prayed
                    for would grow and develop characters that would be more Christlike.

BodyText            I now use the Bible more when I pray for others and myself. The
                    prayers in scripture are beautiful and encouraging like the one in
                    the first chapter of Colossians. My prayer life has been deepened
                    as I have used the Bible to shape my prayers. I often find that
                    God directs me to the right verse to pray to meet a specific need.

BodyText            I will be forever grateful to Harold for teaching me this
                    powerful way to add strength and purpose to my prayers.

Prayer              Prayer: Thank you, dear Father, for the power of your
                    word. Continue to show us how to use it as we pray. Amen.

Title               God's Faithfulness to Us

LongReading         Read 2 Timothy 2:8-13

QuotedScripture     If we are faithless, [Christ] remains faithful — for he cannot deny himself.

Citation            — 2 Timothy 2:13 (NRSV)

BodyText            Looking at Sarah, I could hardly believe this was the same woman I had known
                    earlier. Now she was in a neuro-psychiatric ward at the hospital suffering
                    with deep depression. Her eyes were heavy and red. This woman who had always
                    been deeply faithful was telling me in a low and tearful voice, “I don’t
                    think God cares about me anymore. I’m not sure I even believe anymore.”

BodyText            Had this been a week earlier, I would have struggled to find words that
                    would give her assurance that God did indeed care about her, that she
                    should continue to trust God with her life. I would have tried to find
                    any words that would lighten some of the pain she was experiencing.
                    But it happened that just days before, I came across 2 Timothy 2:13 in
                    my devotional reading. At the time, the words were a virtuous thought,
                    but they didn’t really speak to me — until I visited Sarah and the
                    words came alive. The verse spoke directly to Sarah’s condition: “If we
                    are faithless, Christ remains faithful — for he cannot deny himself.”

BodyText            As I left Sarah with those words, I saw a ray of hope on her
                    face. I praised the Holy Spirit for leading me to the right place
                    with the right message of God’s love and faithfulness to us all.

Prayer              Prayer: Thank you, dear Lord, for your faithfulness to us.
                    We are sometimes too weak to come to you with our concerns.
                    But you know what they are and you care for us. Amen.

Title               Miraculous Bodies

LongReading         Read Ephesians 4:11-16

QuotedScripture     From [Christ], the whole body, joined and knitted together
                    by every ligament with which it is equipped, . . .
                    promotes the body’s growth in building itself up in love.

Citation            — Ephesians 4:15-16 (NRSV)

BodyText            I was finishing an incredibly stressful semester when one day I awoke
                    facedown on the black-and-white-checkered floor of my college dorm’s
                    hallway. Luckily for me, as I would find out, what had happened was a
                    relatively common form of fainting brought about by fatigue and dehydration.
                    A very simple thing — the misfiring of one nerve — led to my passing
                    out. It was a reminder of how incredibly complicated and miraculous our
                    bodies are. Each is unique. Each has different challenges, struggles, and
                    pains; but each body also has special beauty. The more that modern science
                    tells us about how our bodies function, the more miraculous they seem.

BodyText            In a similar way the body of Christ is a miracle. Despite our many
                    differences, we somehow work together to do the work of Christ in the
                    world. In today’s reading, Paul describes the body of Christ in vivid
                    detail, knit together by ligaments of love. Our striving together is a
                    miracle of love. In spite of our human frailties, God does not keep distance
                    from us but works alongside and through us to do truly amazing things.

Prayer              Prayer: Dear God, thank you for the gift of our bodies.

Title               Such Great Love

LongReading         Read Lamentations 3:22-26

QuotedScripture     The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases, his mercies never come to an end.

Citation            — Lamentations 3:22 (NRSV)

BodyText            The morning my husband left me, I felt hurt and helpless. He had been
                    depressed for several days, and I had been praying for him for months. I
                    loved him; but I knew it was time to let him go and to entrust him to God.

BodyText            I felt a profound sense of loneliness, to the point of feeling diminished.
                    I prayed, and I know our lives will work out in time. I believe in
                    God’s promises and love, but that afternoon I felt a deep sadness.

BodyText            Then I felt God assuring me: “You are truly
                    loved. I am here. This crisis will pass.”

BodyText            Jesus Christ is always present in the most difficult crises and in
                    circumstances of grave pain and anguish. I belong to Christ even
                    as I experience this heartbreaking situation. I will continue to
                    believe in him, and I rejoice that I am a beloved child of God.

Prayer              Prayer: Dear God of love and mercy, help us to turn our troubles and
                    grief over to you and to give you the glory, as we pray, “Our Father
                    which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will
                    be done, as in heaven, so in earth. Give us day by day our daily
                    bread. And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is
                    indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from
                    evil” (Luke 11:2-4, KJV). In the name of your Son, we pray. Amen.

Title               The Mother Heart of God

LongReading         Read Psalm 131:1-3

QuotedScripture     As a mother comforts her child, so will I comfort you.

Citation            — Isaiah 66:13 (NIV)

BodyText            “Mommy!” My daughter’s middle-of-the-night whimper drags me from my cocoon of
                    sleep. She is up yet again with a flu bug that won’t leave her alone, even
                    at two in the morning. Her cries awaken compassion in my sleepy heart, and I
                    use my gentlest touch and my softest voice to make her comfortable again. I
                    pull the comforter up, smoothing her hair with my hand. “Go to sleep now,” I
                    whisper. “Everything’s all right.” She sighs contentedly and closes her eyes.

BodyText            Back in my own bed, I remember a phrase: the mother heart of God. I have
                    heard the phrase before, but tonight I understand it in a new way. It
                    means I am not alone. I feel alone sometimes. When I am the one with the
                    flu or when I wake up in the dark after a bad dream, I long for my mom’s
                    presence and help. I still need her, even though I am 35 and years gone
                    from her house. I think I will always need her special love and protection.
                    It comforts me to think that, although my earthly mother is not at my
                    bedside tonight, God, with the heart of a mother, listens for my cry.
                    God whispers, “Go back to sleep now. Everything’s all right. I’m here.”

Prayer              Prayer: Help us to depend on you, dear God, as
                    a child depends on his or her mother. Amen.

Title               The Gift

LongReading         Read Ephesians 2:1-10

QuotedScripture     It is by grace you have been saved, through faith —
                    and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God.

Citation            — Ephesians 2:8 (NIV)

BodyText            After a childhood bout with rheumatic fever, my mother did not expect to survive
                    into her teens, much less marry and have children. But she lived well into
                    her sixties and welcomed 21 grandchildren into the family. As the youngest
                    of six children, I watched my mother make baby booties and a tiny gown each
                    time one of her daughters or daughters-in-law announced an upcoming birth.

BodyText            Six years after my mother’s death, my oldest sister visited. She gave
                    us a present to celebrate the long-awaited news of our impending
                    parenthood. Smiling, she said the gift was from my mother. Startled,
                    we opened the gift from someone who no longer lived on earth, but who
                    loved us and our unborn daughter. Mom had lovingly fashioned booties and
                    a gown and left them with my sister to give to us at the right time.

BodyText            Mom’s gift reminded me that Jesus offers each of us the gift of forgiveness
                    and eternal life — even many centuries after his death. No gift can be
                    redeemed until it is accepted. Let our acts of giving, whether of time
                    or talent, be a strong reminder of the gift given to us by someone who
                    died many years ago but whose death and resurrection brought us new life.

Prayer              Prayer: Dear Lord, thank you for giving us so much
                    when we have done nothing to deserve it. Amen.

Title               Going for the Goal

LongReading         Read Hebrews 12:1-3

QuotedScripture     Paul wrote, “Forgetting what is behind and straining toward
                    what is ahead, I press on toward the goal to win the prize
                    for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.”

Citation            — Philippians 3:13-14 (NIV)

BodyText            Every summer, cyclists from Britain and abroad arrive to take part in a
                    70-mile rally along the country roads in the area where I live, which starts
                    and ends outside our church. This year, on my way to morning worship, I
                    mingled with the people who had gathered. What excitement! Adults and
                    children shouted, waved, and jumped whenever weary competitors crossed the
                    finish line. A piper in full Highland dress welcomed them. The cyclists
                    were relieved and delighted as they completed the long, hard route.

BodyText            Later, I reflected on that scene and recognized how clearly it illustrated
                    Hebrews 12:1-3. The cyclists traveled light. Nothing slowed them
                    down; even their clothes were body-tight. As they set off, they had a
                    single aim: to complete the course, whatever challenges it presented.

BodyText            We may not be cyclists or runners, but all who belong to Jesus are in
                    a race together. Let us encourage one another not to get sidetracked
                    or to give up. Instead, let us fix our eyes on Jesus, who knows from
                    experience each challenge we face. He guides us to the finish line,
                    where a “great cloud of witnesses” (Heb. 12:1) waits to cheer us home!

Prayer              Prayer: Dear Lord Jesus, help us to fix our eyes on you
                    and encourage one another to finish the race. Amen.

Title               Blessed by Autism

LongReading         Read 2 Corinthians 1:3-7

QuotedScripture     Blessed be the God . . . of all consolation,
                    who consoles us in all our affliction.

Citation            — 2 Corinthians 1:3-4 (NRSV)

BodyText            Our son was diagnosed with autism when he was two years old. My wife
                    noticed subtle changes in his behavior; within months, his language
                    and social interactions became severely diminished. The outgoing boy
                    we knew and loved was gone, fixed in his own world. Nothing could
                    have prepared us for what we were facing. We turned to God, praying
                    for our son’s recovery. Knowing that a complete recovery would be
                    uncommon, we also prayed for our understanding and acceptance.

BodyText            We found a private school that serves children with autism. After six months,
                    our son has changed significantly. We have been able to rally around him as he
                    continues to progress a little each day, one step at a time. By concentrating
                    on intervention and progress, we have developed a healthy perspective
                    toward his condition. We are involved in a healing process, emotionally
                    for our family and developmentally for our child. Now even the smallest
                    improvement feels like the biggest blessing. I firmly believe that through
                    this sudden adversity, we’ve been brought closer to God and to one another.

Prayer              Prayer: O Lord, may we be strengthened by adversities
                    and feel your loving presence with us always. Amen.

Title               Paying Attention

LongReading         Read Colossians 3:12-17

QuotedScripture     [God] has said, “I will never leave you or forsake you.”

Citation            — Hebrews 13:5 (NRSV)

BodyText            My friend told me that some recent repair work in her apartment block
                    required that the electricians turn off the power. She said that she
                    quickly realized how many conveniences she took for granted. The lack of
                    power made everyday tasks impossible: no light, no television, no washing
                    machine, no refrigerator/freezer. She couldn’t cook food or boil a kettle
                    of water or work on the computer or listen to music. Her family’s life was
                    paralyzed. When the electricity finally came back on, happiness reigned!

BodyText            Something similar seems to happen in the way we regard God’s gifts;
                    we take them for granted: air, water, sunlight, the changing of the
                    seasons, birdsongs, flowers, food, a roof over our heads, health, a
                    good mood. How often we delight in all these and more — forgetting
                    to thank God, who sends us these blessings. May an unending hymn of
                    praise sound in our hearts to God — the giver of all good things!

Prayer              Prayer: Dear God, your love for us is made clear in all your gifts to us,
                    especially the gift of your son. Thank you for your endless grace. Amen.

Title               Weakness = Strength?

LongReading         Read 2 Corinthians 12:7-10

QuotedScripture     Paul wrote, “For Christ's sake, I delight in weaknesses,
                    in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in
                    difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.”

Citation            — 2 Corinthians 12:10 (NIV)

BodyText            In job interviews, I am always asked to describe my strengths. One day while
                    preparing for an interview I realized that the more appropriate request would be
                    for me to describe my weaknesses. As a Christian, I am stronger when I am at my
                    weakest and lowest point because Christ strengthens me. At these times I am more
                    willing to submit to his will rather than relying on my strength or knowledge.

BodyText            I have learned that I can view these low points as opportunities to identify
                    and face my weakness so that Christ can strengthen me. When my self-esteem is
                    low, I may be tempted to tear down others so as to hide my own insecurities.
                    Instead I can remember Christ’s love, which changes my attitude so that I
                    no longer feel insecure. If I am feeling hatred or anger, then instead of
                    acting on the anger, I can open my heart to Christ’s unconditional love
                    that replaces the hatred and bitterness. This applies to any emotion that
                    we experience as weakness — including anxiety, fearfulness, frustration.

BodyText            Paul’s teaching in this passage may seem counter-intuitive — that we
                    are strongest when we are weak — but it’s true. We have no strength
                    in our own might or knowledge. But when we surrender our problems
                    to Christ and place our trust in him, Christ will strengthen us.

Prayer              Prayer: Dear Lord Jesus, we place our trust in you so that
                    you can replace our weakness with your strength. Amen.

Title               Twice Over

LongReading         Read Zechariah 9:9-12

QuotedScripture     The Lord says, “Today I declare that I will restore to you double.”

Citation            — Zechariah 9:12 (NRSV)

BodyText            I took my young nephew Mark to a homemade ice cream shop located next to a
                    dairy farm. He ordered a single-scoop chocolate ice cream cone. We walked
                    outside to enjoy our treats and watch the cows grazing nearby. Distracted by
                    the animals, Mark tipped his cone and the ice cream plopped to the ground.
                    I watched his heartbroken face as the chocolate melted into the dirt.

BodyText            We hurried back to the ice cream shop to buy another cone,
                    but the vendor refused our money. Instead he freely gave us a
                    replacement cone with a double scoop — one chocolate and one
                    strawberry. The vendor gave Mark twice over what he had lost.

BodyText            Meditating on today’s reading, I realized that God often treats us
                    like that generous vendor. We hurry to God with our broken dreams,
                    dissolved relationships, and shattered hopes. Placing our hurts
                    into God’s hands, we then can stay close to God through prayer and
                    scripture. As we do, we believe that God will replace the losses in
                    our life with rich blessings. A settling peace, deep joy, and renewed
                    confidence will become ours — gifts from a loving and generous God.

Prayer              Prayer: O God, help us to trust you for
                    blessings that outweigh our losses. Amen.

Title               King without a Crown

LongReading         Read Philippians 2:1-11

QuotedScripture     Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the
                    Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest.

Citation            — Luke 19:38 (NIV)

BodyText            Many years ago a lovely woman named Hazel from Sri Lanka stayed in our home for
                    several weeks during a large, international church conference. At the opening
                    worship service the king of Norway made an appearance. When he arrived, the
                    whole congregation of 2,000 people rose and saluted him, as is our custom.
                    King Olav was a rather modest man and arrived in his usual, plain gray suit.

BodyText            Arriving home that night, Hazel was very quiet. When my mother mentioned
                    how nice it had been to have the king at worship, Hazel answered, “Yes,
                    everything was very fine; but I had expected him to wear his crown.”

BodyText            When Jesus approached Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, he wore no crown, even though
                    the people saluted him: “Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord!”

BodyText            The King of kings, Jesus, does not need a crown to be recognized. When
                    he lived in our world, he walked with, talked with, and touched ordinary
                    people. He was one of them. Jesus is still close to us, offering loving
                    companionship to anyone who seeks him, teaching us to be humble servants.

Title               Prayer and Conflict

LongReading         Read Matthew 5:43-46

QuotedScripture     Jesus said, “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall
                    love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ But I say to you,
                    Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.”

Citation            — Matthew 5:43-44 (NRSV)

BodyText            Although I had been a schoolteacher at a rural school for a long time,
                    one day I found myself in a predicament. Part of the faculty thought
                    the school board was right when they fired a member of the faculty.
                    But some, like me, felt he shouldn’t have been dismissed. Battle lines
                    were drawn, and people on both sides were on edge. Many citizens of the
                    community stopped talking to their old friends. I dreaded going to work.

BodyText            Then I began to read the Bible more and realized that God didn’t want
                    us to take sides and to be angry with each other. When I prayed that
                    both groups would get along, I was amazed how my feelings changed. Over
                    a period of time, I found that I couldn’t remain angry at someone I was
                    praying for. So, I prayed for all involved, especially those with whom I
                    differed. My concern spilled over until I wanted only the best for them.

BodyText            As I continued to pray for the welfare of everybody
                    involved, my tense feelings disappeared. Peace came into
                    my heart. Soon my old friendships were alive once more.

Prayer              Prayer: Dear Lord, help us not get so caught up in differences of
                    opinion that we forget to care for everybody involved. Help us
                    remember we are sisters and brothers, children of your family. Amen.

Title               Supporting Roles

LongReading         Read Psalm 8:1-9

QuotedScripture     The psalmist wrote, “When I look at your heavens, the work of your
                    fingers, the moon and the stars that you have established; what are human
                    beings that you are mindful of them, mortals that you care for them?”

Citation            — Psalm 8:3-4 (NRSV)

BodyText            During my freshman year of college I got my very first part in a play. I
                    played a paperboy, and I think it was the smallest part. I came on stage,
                    annoyed all the other characters, and left. Today, almost 30 years later,
                    I can barely remember the plot of that play. But if anyone had asked at
                    the time, I would have told them that it was all about the life of a
                    paperboy — even though I was on the stage a grand total of three minutes!

BodyText            I must confess that sometimes I think life is all about me — my own troubles,
                    agendas, and aspirations. However, now and then the facts bring me back to
                    reality. I read recently that scientists estimate that over 100 billion
                    people have lived on the earth, and that there are hundreds of millions of
                    galaxies in the universe. All of this is in the hands of our mighty God.
                    Even knowing this, I am still tempted to see myself as the “star of the
                    show.” Jesus said that God loves each one of us — that God has counted
                    the number of hairs on our individual heads. (See Matt. 10:30 and Luke
                    12:7.) I find that God often reminds me that I am called to a supporting
                    role, and that real joy is found in putting God and neighbor first.

Prayer              Prayer: Dear God, we confess that sometimes we are wrapped
                    up in ourselves and forget about others. Help us to open
                    our hearts to a bigger world and a bigger love. Amen.

ThoughtForTheDay    Thought for the DayToday, I will take a
                    lesser role and put God and others first.

Title               The Monster in the Cellar

LongReading         Read Judges 6:12-24

QuotedScripture     The Lord said to [Gideon], “Peace! Do not be afraid. You are not going to die.”

Citation            — Judges 6:23 (NIV)

BodyText            When I was young, I was often afraid. I dreaded suppertime, when my
                    mother sent me to the cellar to retrieve canned goods. I was certain that
                    a monster lurked there in the dark. Down the wobbly staircase I went,
                    eyes wide, to find a can of peas or corn. Then I turned my back on the
                    darkness, sure the monster would emerge to chase me up the 13 steps.

BodyText            On the third step, I swallowed hard. Halfway up, my heart began to thump. At
                    the tenth step, I couldn’t breathe. Finally, I dashed into the lighted kitchen,
                    slammed the door behind me, and collapsed with relief, having escaped the
                    monster once again. “For goodness sake, Lori Ann!” Mother rolled her eyes,
                    exasperated with my drama; and then she heartlessly sent me back for more.

BodyText            Fear is a powerful emotion that affects heart rates, thoughts, and actions.
                    Even as adults, we struggle against fears as big as death, as small as
                    spiders or snakes, and as common as looking foolish. God reminds us that
                    we have the responsibility and power not to be paralyzed by fear. If we
                    focus our thoughts on God, not on the monsters we imagine are stalking
                    us, then like Gideon, we will find peace even in the midst of the battle.

Prayer              Prayer: Dear Father, help us focus our thoughts on
                    Jesus so that we remain in control of our fears. Amen.

Title               Desert Places

LongReading         Read Philippians 4:10-14

QuotedScripture     Though the fig tree does not blossom, and no fruit is on the
                    vines; though the produce of the olive fails, and the fields
                    yield no food; though the flock is cut off from the fold, and
                    there is no herd in the stalls, yet I will rejoice in the Lord.

Citation            — Habakkuk 3:17-18 (NRSV)

BodyText            Can anything bear fruit in the desert? I believe
                    people of faith can answer with a resounding “Yes!”

BodyText            I am learning to put into practice some principles that I have read
                    and heard about for a long time. Even in great financial stress and
                    crisis, we should continue to tithe and to help those in need. I am
                    fascinated by Jesus’ story of the poor widow who offered all she had
                    to the temple treasury and received praise from Jesus. (See Mark
                    12:41-44.) It is difficult at times for us to give. When our resources
                    diminish, so does our generosity. But this story of the widow’s offering
                    acknowledges that no matter our circumstances, we have something to give.

BodyText            In the desert places of life, I have learned to be more
                    grateful. I have found God’s peace no matter the conditions or
                    circumstances of my life. And in doing so, I have been able to offer
                    encouragement to others. I have also found my own faith renewed.

Prayer              Prayer: Dear loving God, in our desert places you fill us with hope. We
                    thank you and trust you in all the circumstances of our lives. Amen.

ThoughtForTheDay    Thought for the DayGod always provides streams of water
                    for our journey through the desert. (See Isa. 35:6.)

Title               Still Enjoying Life

LongReading         Read Isaiah 12:1-6

QuotedScripture     Give thanks to the Lord, call on his name.

Citation            — Isaiah 12:3 (NRSV)

BodyText            For 12 years Sheral and I owned an inn in Iowa where we hosted a variety
                    of interesting guests. One of them, Dave, visited us frequently. He was
                    a graduate of Harvard and a retired newspaper editor. He acted in and
                    directed plays into his 80s. He and his wife had no children. Ten years
                    ago Dave’s wife entered an Alzheimer’s care center. She has not recognized
                    Dave for years — but every day Dave visits her, taking her a cut flower.

BodyText            One evening Dave and I were sitting on our front porch when he
                    reflected: “Every night I get some cheese and crackers and something
                    to drink, and I sit in my living room and turn off the lights.
                    Then I thank God for what I have: my art, my music from Mozart, my
                    books, and my memories. I thank God that I can still enjoy life.”

BodyText            In the 12th chapter of Isaiah we find the prophet saying, “Give thanks
                    to the Lord, call on his name.” Isaiah also knew difficult times, yet he
                    gave thanks for the comfort, trust, and strength that he received from
                    “the Holy One of Israel.” Isaiah and Dave both made time to thank God
                    for the joy of living. They have inspired me to do the same — daily.

Prayer              Prayer: O God, even if life at times is busy, stressful, or boring, direct
                    our lives in such a way that we can love and enjoy you forever. Amen.

ThoughtForTheDay    Thought for the DayI will thank God, who helps me enjoy all of life’s wonders.

Title               Righteousness

LongReading         Read Hebrews 10:16-22

QuotedScripture     [God's] righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe.

Citation            — Romans 3:22 (NIV)

BodyText            Because I don’t do much baking, I haven’t invested in many utensils and
                    often have to improvise. For instance, when following directions that
                    call for “a large mixing bowl,” I can compare only among the dishes I
                    own myself. Surely this bowl is large enough, I reason. Look how much
                    bigger it is than my others. Unfortunately, this sometimes results
                    in overflowing batter when, in fact, my largest bowl is too small.

BodyText            Personal righteousness is similar. We compare ourselves to
                    things most familiar to us — other people. We may think, Since
                    I haven’t committed adultery or murdered anyone, and I don‘t
                    cheat on my taxes like others do, surely God is pleased with me.

BodyText            Scripture tells a different story. God doesn’t compare us to our neighbors or
                    even to the likes of Christian martyrs. The measure of righteousness is God’s
                    own perfection. When called “Good Teacher,” Jesus answered, “No one is good
                    but God alone” (Mark 10:18, NRSV). Compared to this standard, we all fall
                    woefully short. Thankfully, our compassionate God “made [Christ] to be sin who
                    knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God” (2 Cor.
                    5:21, NIV). Through Christ we can approach God in confidence, knowing that
                    instead of our sinfulness, God sees the righteousness of Jesus Christ in us.

Prayer              Prayer: Dear Father, thank you for making a provision
                    for us through the sacrifice of your son. Amen.

Title               One Day at a Time

LongReading         Read Matthew 6:25-34

QuotedScripture     Strive first for the kingdom of God . . . and
                    all these things will be given to you as well.

Citation            — Matthew 6:33 (NRSV)

BodyText            Many in our church community are without work. Most people are struggling to
                    make ends meet, and as result a number of churches are hurting financially.
                    Recently, there were insufficient funds in the church bank account to
                    pay our basics and not much room for further budget cuts. We wanted
                    to continue our ministry of worshipping, caring, and growing toward a
                    Christ-healed Africa, but our mission needed money. I confess I was anxious.

BodyText            As I was sitting at the funeral of a colleague on a Friday morning, I had
                    the distinct sense of God encouraging me to stop fussing and fretting about
                    the church and to get on with the work to which I have been called. God’s
                    peace enfolded me. That very Sunday, a church member handed me an envelope
                    and explained that she had dreamed that her late husband instructed her to
                    give this to the church. The envelope contained enough money to wipe out
                    our deficit and keep us going for another few months! God had provided.

BodyText            I know full well a church cannot rely on one-time gifts for daily
                    running costs, but I thank God I have learned all over again
                    that this is primarily God’s work, not mine. We are privileged
                    to be called to play a part and to trust God one day at a time.

Prayer              Prayer: Dear giving God, this day we choose to
                    serve you and trust you for our every need. Amen.

Title               Nothing Can Separate

LongReading         Read Psalm 34:18

QuotedScripture     Paul wrote, “I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels,
                    nor rulers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,
                    nor height, nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be
                    able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.”

Citation            — Romans 8:38-39 (NRSV)

BodyText            Over a year later, we still can’t believe it. I remember the
                    phone call from my wife’s middle sister when their older sister
                    passed away. Another call, later in the evening, explained that
                    their sister had taken her own life. My wife was devastated.

BodyText            None of us had seen her sister’s suicide coming, and all of
                    us wondered why. While I can speculate and offer opinions,
                    I probably will never understand why the tragedy occurred.

BodyText            The outpouring of love from family, friends, neighbors, and church
                    members helped my wife through those challenging days. Friends had the
                    courage to tell her their stories of losing loved ones in similar ways.

BodyText            Even though suicide creates a sad and unexplainable
                    void in many lives, I am certain that as Romans 8:38-39
                    assures us, nothing can separate us from the love of God.

Prayer              Prayer: Dear Lord, when our hearts are broken
                    in tragedy, help us to feel your love. Amen.

Title               More Fruit

LongReading         Read Galatians 5:17-26

QuotedScripture     In days to come Jacob will take root, Israel will
                    bud and blossom and fill all the world with fruit.

Citation            — Isaiah 27:6 (NIV)

BodyText            When spring arrives, I can smell a rosemary bush before I see it. Healthy
                    rosemary plants can produce masses of fragrant leaves and tiny purple blossoms
                    with no help from their owners. Fruitful growth is part of the plant’s DNA.

BodyText            Blooming plants like these remind us that fruitful abundance is also
                    God’s plan for humans, both the Israelites of the old covenant and
                    Christ’s followers. Just as healthy trees produce a wealth of apples
                    or apricots, healthy Christians yield a profusion of love, joy, and
                    peace. God didn’t design us to live a stingy existence with only enough
                    compassion and patience for a few people. God wants the abundance of our
                    spiritual fruit — the love, joy, and patience that reflect God’s image
                    in us — to fill our homes and communities with the fragrance of Christ.

BodyText            Picture a single fruit, and then imagine more of it. More strawberries.
                    More peaches. More fresh melons. If there’s more fruit on the
                    plant, isn’t there more for everyone to enjoy? That’s the reward
                    of abundance, both for plants and trees and for God’s children.

Prayer              Prayer: Dear Lord, we open our hearts to you as the source of spiritual
                    life. Tend our hearts until they overflow with the fruit of your love. Amen.

Title               Remembering

LongReading         Read Exodus 12:14-19

QuotedScripture     [Jesus] took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them,
                    saying, “This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.”

Citation            — Luke 22:19 (NIV)

BodyText            Many years ago, when my wife and I got married, we had the wedding
                    ceremony and evening reception videotaped; recently we watched the
                    video again. It was amazing how many details we had forgotten,
                    even though we had often talked about the wedding over the years.

BodyText            Throughout the Bible God tells people to do certain things so that future
                    generations will remember important events. God instituted the Passover meal to
                    remind the Israelites of their release from Egypt. Offering sacrifices reminded
                    the Hebrew people of their sins and the forgiveness that they could have.

BodyText            Jesus commanded his disciples to remember his death and sacrifice by
                    observing the Last Supper. The early disciples celebrated this meal
                    regularly. No doubt they focused on how the events affected their
                    lives and recalled the words Jesus had spoken while he was with them.

BodyText            How important it is that, in addition to remembering the everyday events of our
                    lives, we also take time to remember and tell others what God has done for us.

Prayer              Prayer: Dear God of past, present, and future, we thank
                    you for all that you have done for us, and we ask that you
                    help us to always remember your goodness and love. Amen.

Title               Everyday Mission Work

LongReading         Read John 15:12-17

QuotedScripture     Jesus said, “This is my commandment, that
                    you love one another as I have loved you.”

Citation            — John 15:12 (NIV)

BodyText            Over the past year, my mother’s health challenges required an inordinate
                    amount of time in hospitals and doctors’ offices. Even though her
                    energy was very low, her illness gave her the opportunity to reach out
                    to those who needed compassion. A grumpy health technician and several
                    individuals who live alone are just a few who were uplifted by her
                    friendliness during uncomfortable medical treatments and by the daily
                    phone calls she made from her bed. Mom did what Jesus would do: she
                    reached out to others when she herself was experiencing a major challenge.

BodyText            During this same time, my dad stepped up and changed his usual routine in order
                    to take superb care of my mother. By making sure she rested, fielding her
                    phone calls, and assuming all household chores, he not only helped her face
                    the health crisis but also conserved some of her energy so she could still
                    tend to others. In the midst of this challenge, they both adjusted their daily
                    routine to continue to serve others, both in and out of the home. Small, quiet,
                    everyday missions like these are likely common, but they often go unnoticed. We
                    can share Jesus’ compassion by serving others in the midst of difficult times.

Prayer              Prayer: Dear God, help us to remember to show your love to
                    others, especially when we ourselves are suffering. Amen.

ThoughtForTheDay    Thought for the DayReaching out to others with
                    the love of Christ refocuses our challenges.

Title               Free to All

LongReading         Read Romans 10:10-17

QuotedScripture     How are they to proclaim [the Lord] unless they are sent?
                    As it is written, “How beautiful are the feet of those who
                    bring good news!” But not all have obeyed the good news.

Citation            — Romans 10:15-16 (NRSV)

BodyText            I waited anxiously at the registration desk. It was 30 minutes past the
                    scheduled starting time, yet only three participants had arrived. The
                    organization had brought in the best instructor and organized every detail of
                    the professional training. All the students had to do was come and learn; no
                    payment was required. Why didn’t they come? I thought. Day one is a disaster.

BodyText            Later that night as I lay in bed exhausted, I prayed: “Lord, help me not
                    to give in to discouragement. Please bring more participants tomorrow
                    because this course could help them so much with their careers. Amen.” On
                    Sunday the course ended with 52% of the expected number of participants.

BodyText            This experience reminds me of an event infinitely greater than this
                    professional training session. At Calvary, God gave us the precious gift
                    of salvation. Jesus stands with open arms and bids us to come to him and
                    receive everlasting life at absolutely no cost. Many have accepted this
                    gift; yet many more have not. As co-workers in God’s vineyard, we can
                    pray for the many who have not accepted the gift of salvation, and we can
                    act as God's hands and feet to spread the message to everyone we meet.

Prayer              Prayer: Dear God, give your children a heart of compassion
                    and tenacity to carry your Gift of salvation to unbelievers.
                    Prepare their hearts to welcome your son. Amen.

Title               When It’s Hard to Praise

LongReading         Read Psalm 145:1-7

QuotedScripture     The psalmist wrote, “My heart overflows with a goodly theme; I address
                    my verses to the king; my tongue is like the pen of a ready scribe.”

Citation            — Psalm 45:1 (NRSV)

BodyText            From a writer’s perspective, nothing is more daunting than a blank page. When
                    I open a new document on my computer, I know that I have to fill that page
                    — and many more — with words. Getting started is often the hardest part.

BodyText            Tentatively at first, I write one word and then another and another.
                    Once I commit those first words to paper, more words usually
                    follow. They may not be the best I could choose, but at least they
                    are words. I keep writing — sentence after sentence, revision
                    after revision — until I have created something worth reading.

BodyText            Sometimes praising God is just as difficult for me as putting words on
                    paper. I feel as though I have nothing to say to the Holy One. But if I
                    am willing to utter a few tentative words of thanks and praise, then the
                    Holy Spirit comes to my rescue. My heart soon overflows with a goodly
                    theme: the grace and mercy and love of God revealed in Jesus Christ.

Prayer              Prayer: Thank you, Holy Spirit, for helping us to praise God. Amen.

ThoughtForTheDay    Thought for the DayThe cure for “praiser’s” block is to start praising.

Title               Learning to Fly!

LongReading         Read Ephesians 4:1-8

QuotedScripture     There is one body and one Spirit . . . one God and Father
                    of all, who is above all and through all and in all.

Citation            — Ephesians 4:4-6 (NRSV)

BodyText            Every year, my husband and I watch purple martins nest in our backyard. We
                    enjoy watching the parents busily feed their new babies. One evening, a flock
                    of purple martins was flying all around our yard, crying out excitedly. The
                    adult birds were flying with a small baby bird in their midst! Some would fly
                    above and in front of the baby urging the baby on, while the others would fly
                    behind and below. I soon realized I was witnessing a baby purple martin learning
                    to fly! The baby bird had emerged from life in a dark nest and, with the help
                    of the flock, was flying into a bright, beautiful, and new world. The whole
                    flock seemed to be dancing in the sky and was celebrating the event with joy.

BodyText            As new Christians emerge from the darkness of unbelief into a new life
                    of faith in the body of Christ, brothers and sisters in the faith can
                    become like that flock of birds — lifting new Christians up, urging
                    them on, and encouraging them in the faith. We can celebrate their
                    faith journey with joy because we know these new Christians will
                    experience a relationship with God and feel God’s limitless love.

Prayer              Prayer: Dear God, inspire us through the help of your Holy
                    Spirit to encourage our brothers and sisters in the faith
                    as we celebrate with joy our relationship with you. Amen.

Title               A Humble Prayer

LongReading         Read Luke 18:9-14

QuotedScripture     The prayer of the righteous person is powerful in what it can achieve.

Citation            — James 5:16 (CEB)

BodyText            Before retiring, I served on the pastoral staff of Sydney’s Wesley Mission.
                    It is centrally located on one of the city’s main streets, not far from two
                    underground railway stations and several city bus routes. Many people with
                    special needs meet at the mission and find it to be a place of care. In one
                    of several congregations for which I was responsible, almost half of the
                    members were living with mental illness, a number of them with schizophrenia.

BodyText            After one of our weekly lunch-hour services, I saw two men patiently
                    waiting for me in the glass-walled church. I went over and sat with them.

BodyText            “We would like you to pray with us,” they said.

BodyText            As soon as I had prayed, one of the men prayed, “God, save
                    us from doing anything to harm ourselves or anyone else.”

BodyText            Twelve years later, I am still deeply moved by his prayer.
                    I am blessed by his deep cry for God’s help and by the
                    prayer’s sincerity, simplicity, humility, and trust.

Prayer              Prayer: O God, move us all with a deeper caring for people
                    who are living with mental illness. May our actions
                    reflect our concern and our lives reflect your love. Amen.

Title               With Whom Are You Walking?

LongReading         Read Micah 6:6-8

QuotedScripture     What does the Lord require of you? To act justly
                    and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.

Citation            — Micah 6:8 (NIV)

BodyText            These words from the prophet Micah serve as a reminder of what God
                    requires of us. First, God wants us to do what is right — obeying
                    both God’s laws and the laws of the land in which we live. Second,
                    God requires that we love mercy, having compassion on others without
                    judging them or their situation. Third, we are to walk humbly with
                    God — putting our will aside and allowing God to lead the way.

BodyText            In the book of Genesis, we learn that we were created in God’s image.
                    I often ask myself, “Am I reflecting God’s image today?” The words of
                    Micah above are the gauge I use to monitor my actions. When I am in a
                    position of authority, do I do what is right? If others offend me, do
                    I forgive or do I hold on to the pain and wait for an opportunity to
                    hurt them in return? Am I humble in my walk with God, allowing God to
                    lead my steps, or do I rely on only my qualifications and contacts?

BodyText            Jesus sums up Micah’s message when he says that we are to love
                    the Lord our God with all our hearts, all our souls and all our
                    minds, and love our neighbors as ourselves. (See Matt. 22:34-40.)

Prayer              Prayer: Dear heavenly Father, lead us today as we try to walk
                    humbly with you. Help us to see you in everyone we meet so that
                    we may show your mercy and your righteousness to them. Amen.

Title               Facing Financial Fears

LongReading         Read James 2:14-17

QuotedScripture     God will meet all your needs according to
                    the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus.

Citation            — Philippians 4:19 (NIV)

BodyText            I was sitting at the table with Mary and two other women from church.
                    We had recently started meeting for a weekly Bible study. Mary suddenly
                    started sobbing. Through her tears, she said, “We don’t have enough
                    money to pay this month’s bills. I don’t know what we’re going to do.”

BodyText            “God will supply all your needs,” I quickly said, paraphrasing
                    Philippians 4:19. I was a new Christian, and I felt confident
                    that Mary would be comforted by this verse and assured to
                    know she did not have to worry about her financial problems.

BodyText            It wasn’t until years later when my own family was short on money
                    that I realized how flippant I must have sounded to Mary that day. My
                    husband Kurt was recovering from brain surgery and unable to work, and
                    hospital bills were an added burden. No one merely recited a Bible verse
                    to us. Instead, loving, generous friends and members of the church
                    fulfilled the scripture by bringing us meals and giving us grocery
                    store gift certificates. God works through us to do his will on earth.

Prayer              Prayer: Thank you, dear God, for the generous people who help us when we are in
                    financial need. Open our eyes to see those who need our help. As Jesus taught
                    us, we pray, “Father, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come. Give us each
                    day our daily bread. Forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone who
                    sins against us. And lead us not into temptation” (Luke 11:2-4, NIV). Amen.

                    expensive optical cable in order to enjoy the maximum clarity in picture
                    and sound. After setting everything up, I was not at all impressed with
                    that “super-duper” cable. It would hardly even stay plugged into the TV.

BodyText            Some days later, I was in the store again, looking for something
                    else and overheard someone complaining about their TV cable. The
                    salesperson asked, “Did you remove the cap from the cable?” Hmm,
                    cap. What cap? I wondered. Back at home, I got the cable out again
                    and, indeed, there was a tiny, almost invisible, plastic cap on the
                    cable. Of course, with the cap removed, the cable worked superbly.

BodyText            That experience made me wonder about my spiritual life. What small,
                    seemingly insignificant barriers interfere with my Christian life and with
                    my showing Jesus to those around me? I resolved to constantly look for the
                    small things that get in the way of our functioning superbly as Christians.

Prayer              Prayer: Dear heavenly Father, thank you for all your blessings.
                    Help us to examine ourselves and remove all the little things
                    that prevent us from showing your love to others. Amen.

Title               God Is Light

LongReading         Read 1 John 1:1-10

QuotedScripture     God is light; in him there is no darkness at all.

Citation            — 1 John 1:5 (NIV)

BodyText            As I take my morning walk, I am surrounded by God’s beautiful handiwork:
                    an uninterrupted blanket of wildflowers; thousands of small yellow
                    butterflies fluttering from flower to flower; the aroma of flowers, wild
                    mint, and clover. I hear the songs of birds as they sing to their mates,
                    build nests, and gather seeds and insects for their young. The sun is
                    not quite up, but the sky is already turning a deep, cloudless blue.

BodyText            Most days I am only slightly aware of the beauty of God’s creation.
                    Depression has clouded my mind and will not let go of me. This illness is
                    devastating. Even though God has blessed me in all areas of my life, I have
                    experienced a feeling of darkness and impending doom for most of my 62 years.

BodyText            God’s word has been my source of help. There is no darkness in God. Just because
                    darkness fills my mind, my heart does not feel hopeless. Jesus is alive and
                    well in my heart. God shines a light on my inner being that no darkness can
                    overcome. “The Lord is my light and my salvation — whom shall I fear?” (Ps.
                    27:1) Depression may not leave during my lifetime, but I can be confident
                    that my Lord and Savior is always with me to comfort me and to give me hope.

Prayer              Prayer: Thank you, dear God, for being the light that
                    overcomes darkness. Thank you for your peace and hope. Amen.

Title               Simple Tasks

LongReading         Read 1 Corinthians 4:8-13

QuotedScripture     We are hungry and thirsty, we are poorly clothed and beaten
                    and homeless and we grow weary from the work of our own
                    hands. . . . We have become like the rubbish of the world.

Citation            — 1 Corinthians 4:11-13 (NRSV)

BodyText            Sometimes, I am amazed at how the simplest task is rewarded. One morning,
                    I took used copies of The Upper Room and some religious pamphlets to
                    a local mission. The devotional booklets were placed on a table to be
                    available for the people who came to a chapel service before lunch.

BodyText            As I waited for the security gate to open, I glanced at the homeless women
                    and men who waited with me and wondered if any of them would read the
                    devotions in search of faith for their challenging circumstances. Would
                    they share the booklets with others in our city who lived on the streets?

BodyText            Later that afternoon, I received a call from the chaplain. “All the materials
                    you brought were gone in a matter of minutes. Thank you so much,” he exclaimed.

BodyText            God recycles our meager offerings into something new,
                    often in ways and places we could never imagine.

Prayer              Prayer: Eternal God, thank you for opportunities to serve our neighbors. Help
                    us to spread your love and your words to the people we meet this day. Amen.

Title               Agents of God's Reign

LongReading         Read Acts 1:6-11

QuotedScripture     Jesus said, “You will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come
                    upon you; and you will be my witnesses... to the ends of the earth.”

Citation            — Acts 1:8 (NRSV)

BodyText            In our reading from Acts, Jesus was reiterating what he had said
                    before: “About that day and hour no one knows, neither the angels of
                    heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father” (Matt. 24:36, NIV). Jesus’
                    parables consistently conclude with the challenge for his followers
                    to be “faithful servants” who are doing their Lord’s work every day
                    with the urgency of those who know that any day could be their last.

BodyText            The good news is that we are given power to live now in ways
                    that are consistent with the values of God’s kingdom. We are
                    called to prepare the way for God’s reign of gracious love,
                    social justice, human reconciliation and peace in our world.

BodyText            God’s promise is not to destroy this world but to redeem it: “God did
                    not send the Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that
                    the world might be saved through him” (John 3:17, NRSV). With these
                    words Jesus calls us not to abandon this earth but to be a part of its
                    healing and redemption by the power of the Spirit of God at work in us.

Prayer              Prayer: Dear God, bring healing to the world through our witness. Amen.

Title               Guided by the Spirit

LongReading         Read Romans 8:22-27

QuotedScripture     The Spirit helps us in our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as
                    we ought, but that very Spirit intercedes with sighs too deep for words.

Citation            — Romans 8:26 (NRSV)

BodyText            Our village in Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo lies in a
                    mountainous region of equatorial tropical forest. There is a story about a
                    seven-year-old boy who was sent by his parents to the nearest village to
                    look for firewood. On his way, he met a lion. Frightened, he stopped and
                    couldn’t move. However, the young boy remembered the prayer he was taught
                    by his parents; he closed his eyes and prayed like this: “O Lord, bless
                    this food before we eat it. In Jesus’ name. Amen.” Miraculously, when he
                    opened his eyes, he could not see the lion, and he continued on his way.

BodyText            His short prayer, uttered out of context, was nonetheless answered.
                    His prayer was no better than anyone else’s. For each of us the Holy
                    Spirit intercedes and shapes our prayers. Prayer does not depend on
                    particular words or repetitive sentences. Prayer is guided by the Holy
                    Spirit. How many times have we found ourselves praying for something
                    other than what we intended? That is the Spirit working through our
                    prayers. None of us knows how to pray without the help of the Holy Spirit.

Prayer              Prayer: Dear Lord, may your Holy Spirit lead our
                    prayers, and teach us to pray every day. Amen.

ThoughtForTheDay    Thought for the DayOur prayers are shaped and made powerful by the Holy Spirit.

Title               Hope and a Future

LongReading         Read Jeremiah 29:11-13

QuotedScripture     “I know the plans I have for you,” declares the
                    Lord, “plans . . . to give you hope and a future.”

Citation            — Jeremiah 29:11 (NIV)

BodyText            For many years, I worked with lost and troubled youth in a juvenile detention
                    facility. I often prayed that I would be able to plant a seed in these young
                    people that would eventually bear fruit in their lives. A number of years
                    after I retired, I received a letter from a young woman with whom I had
                    worked more than 10 years before. She thanked me for caring about her at a
                    difficult time in her life, and she wanted to let me know about her life today.
                    She was happily married with two children, living a faith-filled Christian
                    life, working as an advocate at an AIDS clinic, and attending college.

BodyText            Later we met up, and in the course of our conversation, I asked her how
                    she had come so far when many in similar circumstances had not made
                    positive changes in their lives. She answered simply, “I found God.”
                    At a turning point in her life, she had prayed for guidance and was
                    blessed with a path when she came across this verse: “You make known to
                    me the path of life” (Ps. 16:11). Today, her faith, the word of God, her
                    Christian husband, and her church encourage her to lead a fruitful life.

BodyText            When I met that confused young girl many years ago, only God could
                    know that one day she would inspire me to persevere on God’s path.

Prayer              Prayer: Dear God, thank you for guidance when we most need it,
                    and thank you also for the grace to follow that guidance. Amen.

Title               A Charge to Keep

LongReading         Read Psalm 71:14-18

QuotedScripture     Gray hair is a crown of glory; it is found on the path of righteousness.

Citation            — Proverbs 16:31 (CEB)

BodyText            Reaching retirement was a milestone that promised long-awaited
                    rewards. I looked forward to traveling, indulging in long-delayed
                    hobbies, and enjoying the benefits of my retirement income. It
                    soon became apparent, though, that a seemingly endless parade of
                    self-indulgent activities was not a fulfilling lifestyle for me.

BodyText            Something was missing, even at the end of a beautiful day of
                    golf or sightseeing. I had an aching sense of unfulfilled need
                    for a deeper relationship with God and my savior. I experienced
                    a painful awareness that serving — and giving of myself — are
                    essential priorities in the life of a Christian at any age.

BodyText            This recent re-awakening drives me to seek a balance — to attend to maintaining
                    my health, intellectual ability, and social growth, and to improve my creative
                    skills. More importantly, I continue to use my talents and resources to focus
                    on local and global service. I now find that retirement can be a ticket
                    to becoming more — rather than less — involved in the work of our Lord.

Prayer              Prayer: Dear Father, continue to show us where
                    our love and work are most needed. Amen.

Title               A Transformed Mind

LongReading         Read 2 Timothy 1:1-7

QuotedScripture     God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but
                    of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.

Citation            — 2 Timothy 1:7 (KJV)

BodyText            Anxiety runs in my family. My mother suffered from depression and a
                    panic disorder that made her seem distant and unaffectionate. But in
                    the 1970s, depression was not widely understood as a disease. We simply
                    accepted that our silent mother who cooked, cleaned, and sewed for us
                    rarely laughed or even smiled. She never complained; she merely endured.

BodyText            As a young adult, I was happy to break free from my gloomy home. But years
                    later, as a mother with a successful career, I found myself falling prey
                    to the same mental patterns. When a problem or crisis cropped up, I became
                    tense and prone to panic. I constantly believed disaster was imminent.
                    This buildup of tension led to a breakdown. One day I couldn’t get out of
                    bed, immobilized by fear. My doctor prescribed medication, and though it
                    helped, I also wanted to ask for God’s healing. I recognized mental habits
                    that needed to be changed and believed in God’s power to set me free.

BodyText            I began to meditate on God’s word. “God has not given me a spirit of fear,” I
                    would repeat over and over as panic welled up inside, making my heart race.
                    Soon I would feel calm wash over me, the calm of God’s power and love, and
                    a sound mind. Years later, I can report that God did indeed give me a sound
                    mind. I rarely experience anxiety now, but when I do, I remember this verse.

Prayer              Prayer: Dear God, our helper, thank you for delivering us from fear and
                    bringing peace to our troubled minds and hearts. In Jesus’ name. Amen.

Title               Come Boldly

LongReading         Read Hebrews 4:14-16

QuotedScripture     Through [Jesus] we . . . have access to the Father by one Spirit.

Citation            — Ephesians 2:18 (NIV)

BodyText            We stood in the corridor of the government offices in Cameroon, West Africa
                    where we were missionaries. A large notice said we could go no further
                    without a special appointment to see the Minister of Health, and appointments
                    were only available on certain days. We had no appointment, and it was
                    the wrong day. But we had traveled for two days to reach the city, and we
                    needed to see the minister that day to register our Mission Health Centre.

BodyText            “Stay here and pray,” said my husband as he walked boldly
                    through the open door of the secretary’s office. He asked her
                    in his limited French, “Is it possible to see the minister?”

BodyText            At that moment, the minister opened his door. “Good morning,” he
                    said in our own language. “Can I help you?” He invited my husband
                    into his office where they chatted like old friends. He provided
                    us with the signed papers we needed. Sometimes it pays to be bold!

BodyText            Since Jesus has opened the way for us, we can come
                    boldly before God — no appointment necessary. Let us
                    not hesitate but come boldly before God with our needs.

Prayer              Prayer: Dear Jesus, thank you for sacrificing so much to open the way for
                    us. Remind us to come boldly and thankfully into your presence. Amen.

QuotedScripture     This is the day that the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it.

Citation            — Psalm 118:24 (NRSV)

BodyText            Shortly after returning from church, my wife and I were greeted by our children
                    and grandchildren. On a day of warm summer breezes, bright sunshine, and a
                    few lazy clouds, we were celebrating Father’s Day. We enjoyed a beautiful
                    day together filled with the sounds of children’s laughter. What a delight
                    to watch the family enjoy the simple pleasures that God has given us!

BodyText            After everyone went home, I reflected on the day. I realized that over
                    the years, I had never thought of making our heavenly Father part of
                    our family celebration. Next year, I will suggest a new tradition —
                    that we attend church together as part of our celebration. What a gift
                    that would be for our Father in heaven and for our entire family!

Prayer              Prayer: Dear heavenly Father, guide us throughout our lives. Help us to
                    recognize the ways you have blessed us so that we can praise you every day,
                    as we pray, “Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy
                    kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this
                    day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.
                    And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the
                    kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever” (Matt. 6:9-13, KJV). Amen.

Title               The Impact of a Loving Father

LongReading         Read Deuteronomy 6:4-9

QuotedScripture     Recite [the words I am commanding you] to your children and talk about them when
                    you are at home and when you are away, when you lie down and when you rise.

Citation            — Deuteronomy 6:7 (NRSV)

BodyText            This Father’s Day, I reflect on my dad and the blessings he has passed
                    on to me. I remember planting the garden with him, learning to swim
                    under his coaching, and going with him to the grocery store each week.
                    In everything we did together when I was a child, I felt cherished.

BodyText            Daddy taught me many life lessons. One was the value of hard work.
                    Another was honesty. If a cashier gave him too much change, even a
                    few pennies, he would quickly return it. My dad also taught me about
                    the importance of spending time with God. We had family devotions
                    nearly every evening, sometimes to my protests. Daddy firmly said,
                    “It’s time for devotions,” even if I was watching my favorite TV show.

BodyText            As an older adult, my dad has demonstrated grace in difficult
                    times. He has been a caregiver to two spouses. He has embodied
                    love, faithfulness, sacrificial giving, and strong faith.

BodyText            I think about people who have no pleasant memories of a loving father, and I
                    pray that they will discover God’s love through other significant people. I am
                    grateful for a dad who served as a role model and helped me to grow spiritually.

Prayer              Prayer: Dear loving God, thank you for parents who embody your grace and
                    love. Enable those who grow up in homes without positive role models to
                    encounter other people who will demonstrate your love for them. Amen.

Title               Do We Know What We Are Doing?

LongReading         Read Luke 6:27-36

QuotedScripture     Jesus said, “Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,
                    bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.”

Citation            — Luke 6:27-28 (NIV)

BodyText            When I hear news of a crime, I immediately pray for the victims
                    and their families. It is easy to pray for the victims of crime,
                    but how can we even think about praying for the criminals?

BodyText            In Luke 6:27-28, Jesus is asking us to do something that is against
                    our basic instincts. Our human nature too often insists that we seek
                    revenge when someone does harm to an innocent person; we demand
                    justice or punishment. What Jesus asks of us seems to be impossible.

BodyText            But God created and loves us all — even criminals. As
                    Christians, we are instructed to love and pray for all God’s
                    people, not just the ones whom we deem good and respectable.

BodyText            After all the torture and humiliation that Jesus endured during
                    his crucifixion, he said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not
                    know what they are doing” (Luke 23:34). As followers of Christ, we
                    can embrace and follow Christ’s example, beginning with prayer.

Prayer              Prayer: Dear God of grace, teach us to forgive others as you forgive us. Amen.

Title               Walking in His Light

LongReading         Read John 1:1-5

QuotedScripture     Jesus spoke to them, saying, “I am the light of the world. Whoever
                    follows me will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life.”

Citation            — John 8:12 (NRSV)

BodyText            On the day we moved to our new farm home in January 1940, my eight-year-old
                    world suddenly became larger and more intimidating than ever before. After
                    supper, Dad invited me to go with him to check the animals for the night. As
                    we walked, my dad’s kerosene lantern swung, its light moving back and forth as
                    though alive. The shadows seemed to move and come ever closer. “Dad!” I cried
                    out in fear. He suddenly stopped, and I ran smack-dab into him. Dad’s chuckle
                    came just before he said, “Don’t be afraid. Just walk to the edge of the light.”

BodyText            Just as my earthly father comforted me, so our heavenly Father comforts
                    us in our moments of fear when darkness threatens to consume us. As our
                    quoted verse states, if we follow Jesus, we will never walk in darkness.

BodyText            When the nightly news is filled with reports of economic stress, terrorism,
                    catastrophic weather, and uncertainty for the future of our families,
                    darkness can overwhelm us. Yet even in the darkest moments, the light
                    of Christ still goes before us. His light shines in the darkness and
                    the darkness cannot overcome it. We need not fear. Christ is constantly
                    providing a circle of his light as our place of safety and comfort.

Prayer              Prayer: Dear heavenly Father, even though the future is not
                    clear, may we find comfort in the knowledge that you are
                    already there, lighting the way. In Jesus’ name we pray. Amen.

Title               Like Father, Like Daughter

LongReading         Read Psalm 119:169-176

QuotedScripture     The psalmist wrote, “I have gone astray
                    like a lost sheep; seek out your servant.”

Citation            — Psalm 119:176 (NRSV)

BodyText            I don’t know how Ruby does it. Fifty-five years after she and Ted were
                    married, Ted is now lost in dementia. Hopelessly confused about what day
                    it is and where he is, Ted hardly knows any of their friends anymore. His
                    behavior is more and more problematic: He wanders off from their home on
                    imaginary errands; he shouts at Ruby, sometimes even physically struggling
                    with her. Yet, day in, and day out, Ruby lovingly and patiently cares for
                    him. She accompanies him everywhere, explaining his condition to those
                    who don’t understand. Her actions are sincere; Ruby cherishes Ted. Ruby
                    still sees, hidden behind the fog of dementia, the love of her life.

BodyText            Isn’t this how God loves us? Sometimes our minds are focused anywhere but
                    on our loving Creator. At times our behavior is so absurd that we can’t
                    even say afterward why we did what we did. We wander like lost sheep.
                    Yet none of it deters God; in fact, God still cherishes us. I don’t know
                    how God does it, but whenever I see Ruby, I know where she gets it from.

Prayer              Prayer: Dear Lord, you understand our weakness. When
                    we get lost, bring our minds back to your love. Amen.

Title               Blessings All Around

LongReading         Read Luke 12:22-31

QuotedScripture     Seek [God’s] kingdom, and these things will be given to you as well.

Citation            — Luke 12:31 (NIV)

BodyText            As a friend and I walked across a parking lot, he bent over to pick up a coin.
                    I had walked past without seeing it, yet he acted as if he had actually been
                    looking for it. He put the coin in his pocket and said, “Thank you, Lord.” My
                    friend admitted that he frequently found coins on the ground — sometimes even
                    dollar bills. “I look for them, so I find them,” he said. Then he added, “It’s
                    the same with God’s blessings. I look for them, and I find a lot of them!”

BodyText            My friend was right. God’s blessings are so abundant that we frequently take
                    them for granted: family to care about us; friends to share laughter and tears;
                    a home to go to, however humble it might be; talents and abilities to help us
                    make our way in life. All these and so much more are gifts of a loving God.

BodyText            After that day, I began to look for God’s blessings. My friend was right;
                    I found a lot of them! This discovery of God’s abiding love has helped
                    bring contentment to my days. It has also helped strengthen my relationship
                    with others because I realize they too are objects of God’s amazing love.
                    This lesson doesn’t make everyone a friend. But it does motivate me to try
                    to treat others with the dignity and respect all God’s children deserve.

Prayer              Prayer: Dear God, help us look for your presence
                    and your blessings in all of life. Amen.

Title               He Serves, We Serve

LongReading         Read Matthew 20:25-28

QuotedScripture     The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to
                    serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.

Citation            — Matthew 20:28 (NIV)

BodyText            My best friend came to my dorm room later than I expected.
                    “I was washing dishes after the service,” she said. It
                    didn’t surprise me. She loves the Lord and loves to serve.

BodyText            Washing the dishes isn’t a prerequisite to enter the kingdom of God, but serving
                    demonstrates that we are a part of God’s kingdom. Christ washed the feet of
                    his disciples and gave himself for us. When we as Christians serve humbly — do
                    the dirty jobs and put others first — we are being Christ’s hands and feet.

BodyText            When we serve, it’s easier to focus on the One who called us. When we
                    serve, we invite the Holy Spirit to use us to do great things for God’s
                    kingdom. While “washing dishes” isn’t glamorous, if we are faithful
                    in the small, we can be entrusted with much. (See Matt. 25:21.)

Prayer              Prayer: Dear Lord, help us serve others as you did. Amen.

Title               New Strength for a New Day

LongReading         Read Isaiah 43:16-21

QuotedScripture     The Lord says, “See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not
                    perceive it? I am making a way in the wilderness and streams in the wasteland.”

Citation            — Isaiah 43:19 (NIV)

BodyText            I was tired and moody — and in despair. I was about to sign the
                    contract to sell our home. My dear husband of 55 years had died
                    a few months earlier after losing his battle against cancer.

BodyText            Soon after his death I realized that I could not go on living in our
                    home with all I would have to do: maintenance, gardening in summer and
                    snow shoveling in winter, carrying wood for the fireplaces, and other
                    necessary chores. I should have been grateful for actually finding a
                    buyer even before the house was advertised for sale and at a time when
                    buying and selling houses was almost impossible. But I felt bad — even a
                    little guilty — for selling the home we had shared for all these years.

BodyText            I had not had time to read I Dag, the Norwegian edition of The Upper
                    Room, the morning before I left for the real estate agency. But when I
                    returned home, I saw the opened magazine on the kitchen table and read
                    the words above from Isaiah 43:19. My feelings of despair eased. God
                    did not tell me to forget my husband. God did not forbid me to think
                    back on all the good memories with joy. Rather, God invited me to go on
                    with my life with new strength. God is near, in both good and bad times.

Prayer              Prayer: Dear heavenly Father, we thank you for all we have received from
                    you — especially good memories and a loving family and church. Amen.

Title               The Mystery of Communion

LongReading         Read Mark 14:17-25

QuotedScripture     Paul wrote, “As often as you eat this bread and drink
                    the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.”

Citation            — 1 Corinthians 11:26 (NRSV)

BodyText            For a long time I questioned the point of Holy Communion.
                    Then one day it dawned on me as I walked from my pew to
                    the altar rail — a walk that was longer than I’d thought.

BodyText            For me, Communion celebrates the long walk of Christ from life to
                    crucifixion to resurrection. It is the walk that Christians around the
                    world make each Communion service. It is the walk that the saints in
                    heaven walked long before us. The bread we eat reminds me of the manna
                    that God provided to the Israelites in the desert. The wine is the
                    life-giving blood of God’s grace that Christ gave for our salvation.

BodyText            At Communion the story of our faith is constantly being retold and demanding
                    to be heard. At Communion we are committing to serve our brothers and
                    sisters — even the entire world. And when we glimpse the truth that lies
                    within the mystery and Communion becomes more revelation than routine, our
                    lives are radically transformed. Communion is a miracle that empowers and
                    encourages us to take the love of God into the world for the sake of Christ.

Prayer              Prayer: O God, thank you for the mystery of Communion where
                    we experience your presence. Help us to see you in those we
                    encounter. May we know and share your love more completely. Amen.

QuotedScripture     The psalmist wrote, “I would hurry to my place
                    of shelter, far from the tempest and storm.”

Citation            — Psalm 55:8 (NRSV)

BodyText            When I was a child, my family sought shelter in the root cellar when
                    tornadoes approached our area. The cellar was hollowed out of the earth
                    behind our house, and wooden supports held the dirt walls in place. Flush
                    with the ground, its hinged door led to three concrete steps going down.
                    Many a night my family would huddle together alongside jars of vegetables
                    and bins filled with potatoes. We sometimes waited in the dark for hours
                    for relief from the dangerous lightning, wind, and rain. A strong hiding
                    place is absolutely necessary for survival when tornadoes roar overhead.

BodyText            A hiding place is critical during other storms life brings as well: terminal
                    illness, wayward children, financial downturns, and unending conflict. At these
                    times, a dangerous and debilitating fear can roar through our hearts and minds.

BodyText            In Psalm 37:2 the psalmist addresses God as “my hiding place,” reminding us
                    that God alone is our spiritual and emotional shelter. When fear interrupts
                    our lives and drives us to hide in dark despair, God comforts, strengthens,
                    and calms our soul. Sometimes God graciously removes the storm; but always
                    God can remove our doubt and fear when we wait, pray, and seek God's face.

Prayer              Prayer: Dear Lord, thank you that we can be relieved of our fear
                    because of the courage you provide when we spend time with you. Amen.

Title               Carry-Around Baggage

LongReading         Read Matthew 12:25-30

QuotedScripture     Jesus said, “Come to me, all you who are weary
                    and burdened, and I will give you rest.”

Citation            — Matthew 11:28 (NIV)

BodyText            Carry-on luggage on a flight can be cumbersome. My small suitcase
                    is swollen with personal belongings that I prefer to have within
                    reach. I lug it on board, hoping that its girth will go unnoticed.
                    Sometimes, my bag is too bulky to fit in the overhead bin. Once,
                    I had to take it to the front of the plane for storage elsewhere.

BodyText            As I reflected on that incident, I realized that in many ways I have
                    treated sinful habits like carry-on luggage. I have carried around my
                    lust for material possessions, hunger for approval, and appetite for
                    sensual pleasure. I’ve depended on their presence to feel good about
                    myself. However, they offered little relief from my emotional or spiritual
                    struggles. I am learning that God’s opinion of me is what matters. And
                    because Christ is my Lord and Savior, I am accepted, loved, and valued.

BodyText            Jesus gently and lovingly calls each of us to have a personal relationship
                    with him. When we surrender our baggage to Jesus Christ — by daily asking him
                    to help us desire him more than our sinful lusts — we experience intimacy with
                    Jesus through prayer, worship, Bible study, and obedience. Jesus Christ is all
                    that we truly need. And his load — his will for our lives — is easy and light.

Prayer              Prayer: Dear Lord, thank you that we can hand our baggage over
                    to you and experience intimacy, fellowship, and rest. Amen.

Title               Being Accountable

LongReading         Read Hebrews 10:23-25

QuotedScripture     We urge you, beloved, to admonish the idlers, encourage the
                    fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with all of them.

Citation            — 1 Thessalonians 5:14 (NRSV)

BodyText            I went mountain climbing the other day and met up with some energetic
                    students. When I thought I could not possibly go on, they shouted words
                    of encouragement: “You can do it!” “You are one strong lady!” “This is
                    nothing. You’ve made it this far; the worst is over.” At times, they
                    burst into song to boost morale. Together, we made it all the way.

BodyText            This experience reminds me of our Christian walk. Sometimes the battle is too
                    fierce, and we feel we can’t go on. We don’t have the strength even to pray. In
                    such times, we need other people to support, encourage, and admonish us in love.
                    Through Christian fellowship, we have the strength to hold on to God’s sure
                    promises and to continue. Being accountable to one another keeps us on track.

BodyText            Some people say that they need not go to church anymore because they listen
                    to sermons on TV or on the Internet. This practice is no substitute for
                    Christian fellowship. The TV won’t comfort us through hard times, rejoice in
                    our blessings, or keep us accountable. Our brothers and sisters in Christ will.

Prayer              Prayer: Thank you, dear God, for the fellowship of believers. Teach us
                    to cherish it and to play our roles in the community of faith. Amen.

ThoughtForTheDay    Thought for the DayWe are members of the body
                    of Christ and accountable to one another.

Title               In Dark Times

LongReading         Read Romans 8:31-39

QuotedScripture     Jesus said, “Remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”

Citation            — Matthew 28:20 (NRSV)

BodyText            Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a condition in which a vivid life
                    experience continues to replay in thoughts and dreams and at unexpected and
                    unwelcome times. It often originates in a life-threatening event, but it can
                    also affect someone whose world is shaken in a less dramatic but intensely
                    personal way. At its worst, PTSD is paralyzing and hinders daily life.

BodyText            As someone who has personally struggled with PTSD I have wondered, Is it
                    selfish for a person who is battling PTSD to ask God to remove the condition?
                    We can look to the Bible for an answer. Jesus did dramatic healings, but
                    healing was not his main focus. His assurance to us was and is that God
                    is a source of indescribable power and strength, that God cares for us,
                    knows our names, and surrounds us with love. God may not take away, with
                    a single stroke, the intruding images of PTSD. Healing will come at its
                    own pace. Until then, when the images strive to take control, we can
                    reach out to God, who stands beside us. We can be assured that we are
                    of inestimable worth to our creator and that God buoys us up with love.

Prayer              Prayer: Dear God, you are on our right, on our left, in front of
                    us, and behind us. Help us to feel your love carrying us through
                    the dark places in our lives until light shines once more. Amen.

ThoughtForTheDay    Thought for the DayWhen we are in a dark place,
                    God is next to us and yearns to take our hand.

Title               Under His Wings

LongReading         Read Psalm 91:1-6

QuotedScripture     The psalmist wrote, “How precious is your steadfast love, O
                    God! All people may take refuge in the shadow of your wings.”

Citation            — Psalm 36:7 (NRSV)

BodyText            My grandparents used to raise white leghorn chickens — fowls with snow-white
                    feathers and vivid red combs. Sometimes, as a child, I would see a hen squat
                    on the ground, looking as if she were resting from the heat of the day. When
                    she finally stood up, a brood of tiny chicks would come scrambling out and
                    take up position behind her. Anywhere she went, the chicks would follow;
                    if she stopped and held out her wings, they’d scurry back under. For those
                    chicks, the safest place to be was enfolded inside their mother’s wings.

BodyText            Seeing this as a child has given me insight into a statement Jesus
                    made. He was expressing to the multitude his grief over Jerusalem
                    because they had rejected all the prophets God had sent them. Then, in
                    a more tender moment, he exclaimed, “Jerusalem, Jerusalem, . . . . How
                    often have I desired to gather your children together as a hen gathers
                    her brood under her wings, and you were not willing!” (Matt. 23:37).

BodyText            We live in a stressful world filled with problems that can seem overwhelming.
                    Our Savior beckons us to trust him and run for protection within his arms.

Prayer              Prayer: Dear Lord Jesus, may we learn to run to you for protection. Amen.

Title               Gifts Great and Small

LongReading         Read Mark 12:41-44

QuotedScripture     All of them [rich people] are giving out of their spare
                    change. But [one poor widow] from her hopeless poverty has
                    given everything she had, even what she needed to live on.

Citation            — Mark 12:44 (CEB)

BodyText            I was picking the last green peas of the season. The vines were
                    tall, and most contained three or four pods of up to nine peas
                    each. As I went along I found one small plant dwarfed by the rest.
                    On it was one pod of about five peas. As I picked it I thought,
                    It ain’t much, but it did what it could; it gave all that it had!

BodyText            Sometimes we think what someone else has to give “ain’t much.” But we are not
                    called to judge how much someone else gives. God calls each of us to give all
                    we can, no matter how great, no matter how small. And we are called to give
                    thanks for all who give, no matter how great, no matter how small the gift.

Prayer              Prayer: Dear Lord, teach us gratitude for small gifts as well as great gifts and
                    gratitude for the giver of both great and small gifts. We pray as Jesus taught
                    us, saying, “Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come,
                    your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread.
                    And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not
                    into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one” (Matt. 6:9-13, NIV). Amen.

Title               Guess Who’s Back!

LongReading         Read Luke 15:11-24

QuotedScripture     The father declared, “This son of mine was dead and
                    has come back to life! He was lost and is found!”

Citation            — Luke 15:24 (CEB)

BodyText            Our daughter found a stray cat on our porch. Without asking permission,
                    she fed him. Then the inevitable happened: Old Tom made himself at
                    home. Soon his furry grey body and quiet purr became an important
                    part of our lives. But he had not given up his street life; he would
                    disappear for weeks at a time. Just when we decided he was gone
                    for good, he would return — a torn and bloody skeleton of a cat.

BodyText            The prodigal son had some of Old Tom in him. But so do we! While we enjoy the
                    comfort of being part of God’s family, our independent nature at times gets
                    us into trouble, and we end up spiritually — and sometimes even physically
                    — starved and wounded. No matter how many times Old Tom wandered off, it
                    was a day for rejoicing when someone shouted, “Guess who’s back!” Someone
                    would pour him a bowl of milk, and someone else would prepare a warm bath.

BodyText            Our scripture tells us that God’s welcome mat is always out,
                    no matter how many times we stray. Imagine the cheering for
                    us from heaven when someone shouts, “Guess who’s back!”

Prayer              Prayer: Dear Lord, our willful nature causes us to stray from your loving
                    care. Thank you for welcoming back your foolish, straying children. Amen.

Title               Gardening

LongReading         Read Psalm 104:13-23 (NRSV) John 15:9

QuotedScripture     Jesus said, “As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Abide in my love.”

Citation            — John 15:9 (NRSV)

BodyText            Recently, I have been truly enjoying my garden. I used to simply maintain
                    it — giving it a bit of water and mowing the grass — and then think, Looks
                    good! Lately though, I have been pruning, turning the soil, throwing on some
                    fertilizer pellets, and then topping it with some of my husband’s lovely Lucerne
                    mulch from our hay farm. And the results have been amazing — beautiful bulbs
                    and flowers, flowering bushes and gorgeous roses. The garden looks brilliant!

BodyText            Our lives are like gardens. Sometimes they need to be plowed up or have
                    the soil turned or have branches pruned. Even though it can be painful,
                    it is necessary to cut away the sin in our lives to make room for new
                    growth. We need to apply the fertilizer of God’s word and the water of
                    the Holy Spirit. When we have the basics sorted, then on top of it all,
                    we need to apply the mulch of good fellowship, worship, and prayer.
                    All this helps to keep our hearts and minds growing strong so that we
                    can shine brilliantly for the Lord and work for the kingdom of God.

Prayer              Prayer: Dear Jesus, thank you that you love us as the Father has loved you.
                    You have planted good things in us. Help us to abide in your love so that we
                    can continue to do the things necessary to keep your work alive in us. Amen.
