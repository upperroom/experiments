A Child’s Bible

Read 2 Timothy 3:16-17 and 1 Tim 2:3,5,7

Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.

— Psalm 119:105 (NRSV)

Today's Devotional

When I was a child, my parents kept a collection of Bibles in a fancy glass cabinet in our living room. The Bibles were all different sizes and colors, some new and some old. I loved pulling them out and laying them in a row on the carpet. I would smell their leather covers and turn their delicate pages.

On my sixth birthday, I received a Bible of my own. I took it to Sunday school with me every week. Through the years of my childhood, I memorized verses, learned the stories of heroic prophets and godly men and women, and discovered what it truly meant to desire a personal relationship with Jesus.

One passage, Psalm 119:15-16, became especially powerful for me: “I will meditate on your precepts, and fix my eyes on your ways. I will delight in your statutes; I will not forget your word.” The psalmist clearly had a passion for the word of God that I desired in my own life.

As I have prayerfully studied it, God’s word has provided hope and encouragement to me. I have become more capable of withstanding temptation and false teaching, and more and more I have been molded into the woman that God wants me to be.

Thought for the Day:

Prayer: Dear Lord, help us take the time to meditate on your word, even during the busiest of days. Amen.

Read Ezra 3:1-11

Despite their fear of the peoples around them, they built the altar.

— Ezra 3:3 (NIV)

Today's Devotional

“Trust me. Give it one more shot.” My teacher was encouraging me to go to the second practice of our school’s jazz band. During the first practice, he had handed out music I thought was too hard. I was afraid to fail, to embarrass myself in front of the group. After a lot of coaxing, I agreed to try one more time.

The second practice was much better, and I have continued to play the trumpet ever since. Playing in that band gave me confidence to do things I might never have considered. I’m glad I went — even though I was afraid.

My fear seems insignificant when compared to the fear the Israelite exiles felt as they returned to Jerusalem in the sixth-century BC. Their ancestors had been taken as prisoners of war decades before, but this was no joyful homecoming. The residents of the city were openly hostile to them, and the situation had become very tense. In order to worship they would need to build an altar, risking bodily harm and perhaps death. Still, they chose to worship God.

All of us experience fear of some kind. Yet, the Israelites can inspire us to trust God. They were afraid, but they overcame their fear. If they could trust God in the midst of great danger, so can we.

Prayer: Dear God, when we are afraid and don’t know what to do, help us to be like the Israelites and trust you — despite our fears. Amen.
